# Viewer
File Manager / General Viewer / Command-Line utility / Generic Frontend

Originally Developed as a *.dwg format viewer with minimum dependencies on Windows libraries,
it has grown to be a full file manager or a Generic frontend/GUI to any command-line utility.

It's fully functional however it would need some Refinements, in addition to replacing the *.dwg 
support library to any open source one (libredwg or libdwg). More "C" open source libraries could 
be added to support many formats as needed.

Notse: 
- Select any *.dwg file and press F4 to preview it (few versions are supported).
- Other functions via "F" buttons are self explanatory.
